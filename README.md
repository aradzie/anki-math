# Math notes for Anki

This is my own personal collection of math notes for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

The `*.note` files are the source files for the notes in a simple and human-readable text format.

The [notes.txt](./notes.txt) file is a compiled deck file that can be imported into Anki. It is created by the [notatki](https://github.com/aradzie/notatki) tool.
