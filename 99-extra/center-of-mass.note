!front: What is the formula for the moment of a system of particles about the origin?
!back:
The moment \( \mathbf{M}_O \) of a system of particles about the origin is given by the formula:

\[ \mathbf{M}_O = \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i \mathbf{r}_i \]

- \( m_i \) is the mass of the \( i \)-th particle, and
- \( \mathbf{r}_i \) is the position vector of the \( i \)-th particle.

!front: What is the formula for the center of mass of a system of particles?
!back:
The center of mass \( \mathbf{R} \) of a system of particles is given by the formula:

\[ \mathbf{R} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i \mathbf{r}_i \]

where

- \( m = \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i \) is the total mass of the system,
- \( m_i \) is the mass of the \( i \)-th particle, and
- \( \mathbf{r}_i \) is the position vector of the \( i \)-th particle.
